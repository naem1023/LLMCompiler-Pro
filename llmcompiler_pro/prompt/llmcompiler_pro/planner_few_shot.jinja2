Question: If a cheetah was 1.3 times slower, a greyhound was 1.5 times faster, and a falcon was 2.3 times slower than their maximum speeds, what will be the ratio of the fastest animal to the slowest animal?

1. I need to understand how the cheetah's maximum speed is affected when it's 1.3 times slower. Search about the cheetah.
2. Using the typical maximum speed of a cheetah, I will calculate what the speed would be if it were 1.3 times slower. Calculate the maximum speed of the cheetah if 1.3 times slower using <$1>.
3. To assess the greyhound's enhanced speed, I need to first know its usual top speed. Search about the greyhound.
4. After finding the typical speed of a greyhound, I'll determine what it would be if the speed increased by 1.5 times. Calculate the maximum speed of the greyhound if 1.5 times faster using <$3>.
5. Since the falcon is the fastest bird, I need to find out how much slower it would be if its speed were reduced by 2.3 times. Search about the falcon.
6. With the falcon's standard maximum speed known, I'll calculate the slower speed at 2.3 times its usual rate. Calculate the maximum speed of the falcon if 2.3 times slower using <$5>.
7. Finally, I'll compare the adjusted speeds of all three animals to find out which is the fastest and which is the slowest, then calculate their speed ratio. Determine the ratio of the fastest to the slowest speeds from <$2>, <$4>, <$6>.

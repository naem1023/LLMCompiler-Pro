Question: If a cheetah was 1.3 times slower, a greyhound was 1.5 times faster, and a falcon was 2.3 times slower than their maximum speeds, what will be the ratio of the fastest animal to the slowest animal?

1. I need to understand how the cheetah's maximum speed is affected when it's 1.3 times slower. Search about the cheetah.
2. Using the typical maximum speed of a cheetah, I will calculate what the speed would be if it were 1.3 times slower. Calculate the maximum speed of the cheetah if 1.3 times slower using <$1>.
3. To assess the greyhound's enhanced speed, I need to first know its usual top speed. Search about the greyhound.
4. After finding the typical speed of a greyhound, I'll determine what it would be if the speed increased by 1.5 times. Calculate the maximum speed of the greyhound if 1.5 times faster using <$3>.
5. Since the falcon is the fastest bird, I need to find out how much slower it would be if its speed were reduced by 2.3 times. Search about the falcon.
6. With the falcon's standard maximum speed known, I'll calculate the slower speed at 2.3 times its usual rate. Calculate the maximum speed of the falcon if 2.3 times slower using <$5>.
7. Finally, I'll compare the adjusted speeds of all three animals to find out which is the fastest and which is the slowest, then calculate their speed ratio. Determine the ratio of the fastest to the slowest speeds from <$2>, <$4>, <$6>.

Question: Determine the smaller value: the depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench, or the depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench.

1. To compare trench depths accurately, I first need detailed information about the Mariana Trench. Search for the Mariana Trench.
2. Next, I need to gather data about the Puerto Rico Trench to calculate the depth difference. Search for the Puerto Rico Trench.
3. Using the data from both trenches, I will calculate the absolute depth difference in meters between them. Calculate the absolute depth difference in meters between the Mariana Trench and the Puerto Rico Trench using <$1> and <$2>.
4. I will now search for information on the South Sandwich Trench to prepare for another depth comparison. Search for the South Sandwich Trench.
5. Similarly, I need details on the Sunda Trench to finalize my calculations. Search for the Sunda Trench.
6. With data on both trenches, I'll calculate the depth difference between them to compare with the first pair. Calculate the absolute depth difference in meters between the South Sandwich Trench and the Sunda Trench using <$4> and <$5>.
7. Finally, I'll compare both depth differences to determine which is smaller. Determine the smaller of the two depth differences from <$3> and <$6>.
